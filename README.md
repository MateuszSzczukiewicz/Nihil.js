## Nihil.js

"Behold! Another JavaScript framework you didn't ask for. This one's called NihilJS,
because, well, you get the idea."

This project is my happy-go-lucky attempt to build HTMX-inspired HTML-over-the-wire
and Alpine.js-esque reactivity from scratch. The goal? To finally understand
what those clever library authors are *actually* doing.

It's probably riddled with existential bugs and questionable life choices (in code).
But if the universe is indifferent, why shouldn't my JavaScript be?

**Features:**
*   Probably some.
*   Updates things. Sometimes.
*   Teaches you that building frameworks is hard.

**Use at your own philosophical risk.**
